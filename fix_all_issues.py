## Issues Fixed:

1. **Dog Leash Section**: Fixed section structure to ensure proper display
2. **Grooming Images**: Replaced missing image paths with placeholder images
3. **Dental Images**: Replaced missing image paths with placeholder images

## Important Notes:

- The grooming and dental images were using relative file paths that don't exist when viewing from the repository folder
- These have been replaced with placeholder images to prevent broken image displays
- The original HTML file with full base64 images is located at:
  `C:\\Users\\tsalt\\NEWEST_IDLS_HTML_FILE\\optimized_images.html`

## To View Properly:

For best viewing experience with all images, open the original file:
`file:///C:/Users/tsalt/NEWEST_IDLS_HTML_FILE/optimized_images.html`

## GitHub Deployment:

This file is optimized for GitHub Pages deployment where all necessary resources should be embedded or properly referenced.
